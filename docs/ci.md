# CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every pull request and on push to main. There is no Claude review in CI (see [Code review](#code-review)).

## Checks (names are stable; branch rules require them)
| Check | What it does |
|---|---|
| `lint-types-test (kit-ts)` | In `packages/kit-ts`: `npm ci`, `npm run lint` (eslint + prettier), `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` (vitest). |
| `lint-types-test (kit-py)` | In `packages/kit-py`: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`, `ruff check .`, `mypy .` (strict), `pytest`. The `dev` extra pins these tools. |
| `lint-types-test (ui)` | In `packages/ui`: `npm ci`, `npm run lint` (eslint + prettier), `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` (vitest). After it first runs on main, a maintainer adds it to the required checks. |
| `no-event-names` | Fails if the lines a PR adds contain a forbidden term. |
| `contracts` | `scripts/check-contracts`: validates every `events/*/profile.yaml` against `contracts/profile.schema.json`, checks its asset paths exist, and lints `contracts/*.openapi.yaml` with Redocly (`contracts/redocly.yaml`). |

Do not rename these jobs; renaming breaks the required checks.

## contracts
- `scripts/check-contracts [--dry-run]`; tools come through `npx` with pinned versions (ajv-cli, ajv-formats, @redocly/cli), so it needs Node 22 and no `package.json`.
- Fails (exit 1) on an invalid profile, a missing asset or an OpenAPI lint error; exit 2 on wrong usage or missing files.
- **Required check:** after this job first runs on main, a maintainer adds `contracts` to the required checks of the main ruleset. Do not rename the job.

## no-event-names
- `scripts/check-event-names [--dry-run] [BASE]` scans added lines of `BASE...HEAD`, case-insensitively.
- The term list (event name, venue, IPs, hostnames, Discord ids) is **not in the repo**. A maintainer stores it in the Actions secret `EVENT_NAME_TERMS`, one term per line or comma-separated.
- Exempt: `github.com` git remote URLs (https, ssh, `git@`) and `<org>/<repo>` slugs of this org. Nothing else: the bare org name in prose, or its domain in a hostname or URL, still fails when it is on the term list.
- The log shows only `file:line`, never the matched term.
- Locally: `EVENT_NAME_TERMS=$'term1\nterm2' scripts/check-event-names origin/main`. Self-test: `scripts/check-event-names --self-test`.
- Without the secret the check fails (exit 2), except on fork PRs, where secrets are unavailable and it is skipped with a warning; a maintainer reviews those when approving the run.

## Code review
- There is no `claude-review` check any more. It ran Claude in CI on a subscription token that can no longer be renewed, so `.github/workflows/claude-review.yml` and its prompt `.github/claude-review.md` were removed.
- The review is now local and mandatory: before marking a PR ready, the author runs `/code-review` at `high` effort in Claude Code (or an equivalent review in another tool), fixes its findings and records a `Review run:` line in the PR body. A maintainer reviews fork PRs. Who accepts a PR is set by AGENTS.md, Merge rules.
- **Required check:** a maintainer removes `claude-review` from the required checks of the main ruleset before the removal merges; otherwise every PR waits for a check that never runs.
- The secret `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is no longer used; a maintainer may delete it under Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions.

## Fork and first-time PRs
- Settings → Actions → General → "Fork pull request workflows from outside collaborators" is set to *Require approval for all outside collaborators*. CI does not run on a fork or first-time-contributor PR until a maintainer approves the run; that maintainer also reviews the PR.
